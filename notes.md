- work on basic template: using `rawHtml` make it available in nimib
- need to add at least some TangleKit (does not seem to be optional)
- issue (solved, it was a case sensitivity issue `window.onload`)
  - replace onload body attrbiute with `window.onLoad` does not seem to work
  - example works if I call `setUpTangle()` from console
- issue (solved, I copied and pasted from modified dom instead of source, no influence of water.css)
  - it is a bit broken, after number it starts a new paragraph (influence of water.css?)
