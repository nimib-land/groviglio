- work on basic template: using `rawHtml` make it available in nimib
- need to add at least some TangleKit (does not seem to be optional)
- replace onload body attrbiute with `window.onLoad` does not seem to work
- example works if I call `setUpTangle()` from console
- it is a bit broken, after number it starts a new paragraph (influence of water.css?)
